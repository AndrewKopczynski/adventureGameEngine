Magnetic Disks (1)
- Unless you're really interested, not really worth reading about magnetic disk really. Everything from here to the rest of the chapter is optional reading.
- They've got sectors, tracks contain sectors, there's X tracks per disk.

Integrated Circuits
- Figure 3-10
- Common types of integrated-circuit packages, including a dual-inline package (a), pin grid array(b) and land grid array (c).
- a looks a lot like those chips in electronics, like the 555 timer
- b looks a lot like a CPU
- c is a typical CPU nowadays too

- Most of a chip is just a protective shell usually, the chip is almost always a fraction of the size. Chips need such huge chips because they generate an OBSCENE amount of heat.

Multiplexers (1)
- Figure 3-11

- Remember the Sum of Products: For outputs ABC, you write them for the outputs of 1

A | B | C | OUT
------------
0 | 0 | 0 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1
0 | 1 | 0 | 1

M = ((NOT A) AND (NOT B) AND C) OR (NOT A) AND B AND (NOT C)

also written as

M = ¬A¬BC * ¬AB¬C

- Figure 3-11 is an 8 pin multiplexer
- Designed for a certain number of inputs (control lines)
- For a particular setting of control lines, it will control the 8 inputs to change the output
- Don't worry about why, just understand that it has 8 inputs and can be controlled by the control lines to change the output

- Multiplexers are basically a hard-wired truth table
- You can put whatever truth table you want into it too.
