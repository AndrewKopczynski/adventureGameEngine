Research and Documentation

- physical research
-> doing it yourself
	- it's usually really really expensive
	- not all research is good, can fail or be thrown out
	- research generally means no revenue (while researching)
	- research needs a lot of expensive talent
	- gotta have research facilities

- academic research
-> reading about someone else who already research that thing
	- why do it?
	-> to access the brain trust already out there
	- find out what's been done before
	- it's cheaper to read about it than to do it
	- use it as a starting point for your research

- searches
	- internet search engines
	- wikipedia
	- news sites
	- gov't research
	- library databases
	- books
	
- top businesses searches (good stuff to search)
	- locate buyers or new markets
		- maybe it hasn't been done before because there's no market
	- find market info for a business plan
	- track gov't and industry bids and contract awards
	
- your academic research
	- find out whats been done before
	- provide a starting point for research
	- incorperate their results
		- provide a starting point
			- once you know whats been done, then you can begin doing something different
			- creativity doesn't exist in a vaccum (it comes from research and thinking of
			what other people missed or didnt take adavantage of)
			- if all you find is failure, then you know to do something else or do it
			differently
			
			- people quote other people all the time:
				- "I read there are droughts in Africa... it's all part of global warming."
				- "The weatherman says it's going to rain."
				- "Rotten Tomatoes rates Looper at 93%."
					- some authories are better than others
			- use others to support you
				- their quotations are your evidence
				- the quotations are used to support your claims and conclusions
				- you might explicitiy refer to their authority
				- "3 out of 4 doctors agree..."
				- "According to John Dvorak, Apple doubled its value in the last two years."
				- You can also quote someone to show how wrong they are
					- "According to Micheal Delel in 1986 [apple should just shut down]"
				- Your disagreement with someone can be the starting point of your argument
				- Being really wrong ruins someone's authority
				
				- "Steve Jobs belieced that closed systems were the best; however, he quickly
				lost market share to Microsoft when the rest of the world disagreed."
				- For a long time, Jobs seemed to be wrong
				- Lately, he seems to have been less wrong
				
				- "Apple believes that the future of computing lies with the cloud; however
				bandwidth and security concerns may keep that future from taking place."
				- Is this statement true? Or is the future merely delayed?
				
		- Quoting v Paraphrasing
			- Quouting invovles using someone else's exact words
			- Paraphrasing involves using your own words to summerize what someone else
			has done or said
			- If their words say it better, use their words
			- If they said it in a very wordy or difficult to understand way, paraphrase
				- "Success or failure in competitive activies exhibs no tendancy to be
				commensurate iwith innate cpacity, a considerable element of the
				unpredicatable must invarbily be taken into account" (Smith, 1998)
				- Paraphrased: Sometimes, luck plays a significant part in sucess (Smith, 1998)
				
			- Have lead-in sentence to a quote, quote, then end punctutation and citation.
				- According to John Dvoak, "Apple wants to make computers as common as toasters" (2010)
				- Notice if we introduce the person in the sentence that we don't need to list their
				name in the citation too
				
			- Avoid accusations of plagiarism
				- srsly don't
				- cheating is bad
				- citing however, is good
					- giving credit, doing research is good
					- not giving credit is plagiarism
		
		- Citation Format
			- Use APA format (no foot notes)
			- See Appendix B in text
